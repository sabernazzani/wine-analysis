### Coding Countries
`country_iso` was added to dataset to code countries by their respective ISO code

### Import `NLTK` and Download Associated Lexicon
The function `NLTK` is not a pre-installed python package thus it required an installation. I used the command `!pip install NLTK`. `NLTK`â€™s feature of interest is the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` command and more specifically the `polarity_scores` method. In order to use this it needs an additional download of the `vader_lexicon`

## Sentiment Analysis
### First function: `get_sentiment_score`
The goal of this function is to condence every review in a score ranging from -1 to 1 and simplify the price:quality analysis under study. 

### Second function: `bucketing`
